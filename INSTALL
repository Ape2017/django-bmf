Installation
############

This document assumes you are familiar with Python and Django. It should
outline the steps necessary for you to follow the tutorial.

************
Requirements
************

* `Python`_ 2.7.X
* `Django`_ 1.7.X
* `django-mptt`_
* An installed and working instance of one of the databases listed in the `Databases`_ section.

.. note:: When installing the django ERP using pip all requirements are installed automatically.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org
.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com
.. _django-mptt: https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt

Recommended
===========

These packages are not *required*, but they provide useful functionality with
minimal additional configuration and are well-proven.

* `django-celery`_

************************************
Installing in a virtualenv using tox
************************************

Installing inside a `virtualenv`_ is the preferred way to install any Django installation. This approach should work on
any platform where python and `tox_` are installed:

.. code-block:: bash

  #!/bin/sh
  tox -e develop


************************************
Installing in a virtualenv using pip
************************************

Installing inside a `virtualenv`_ is the preferred way to install any Django installation. This should work on
any platform where python in installed. The first step is to create the virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

  #!/bin/sh
  sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv
  virtualenv --distribute --no-site-packages env

You can switch to your virtualenv at the command line by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

  source env/bin/activate
  
Next, you can install packages one at a time using `pip`_, but we recommend using a `requirements.txt`_ file. The
following is an example requirements.txt file that can be used with pip to install django ERP and its dependencies:

::

    # Bare minimum
    django-erp

    
for Postgresql you would also add:

::

    psycopg2==2.5
    
and install libpq-dev (on Debian-based distro)

for MySQL you would also add:

::

    mysql-python==1.2.4

and install libmysqlclient-dev (on Debian-based distro)

.. _virtualenv: http://www.virtualenv.org
.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org
.. _tox: http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
.. _requirements.txt: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/cookbook.html#requirements-files

*********
Databases
*********

We recommend using `PostgreSQL`_ or `MySQL`_ with django ERP. Installing and
maintaining database systems is outside the scope of this documentation, but
is very well documented on the systems' respective websites.

To use django ERP efficiently, we recommend:

* Creating a separate set of credentials for django ERP.
* Creating a separate database for django ERP to use.

.. _PostgreSQL: http://www.postgresql.org/
.. _MySQL: http://www.mysql.com
